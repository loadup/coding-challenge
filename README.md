## Project

Write a small app to display weather data, basically a simplified [weather.com](https://www.weather.com), that takes an input from the user about their location and displays local weather in that area.

### Requirements

* Has a single button in the center called "Current Weather"
* Upon click, it uses the built-in browser [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the user's location
* The application then grabs the current weather for that location from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current) and displays it on the page
* The application allows persisting weather reports to a database
* Deploy your project somewhere so it's accessible from the web. Heroku or a static host if you're going that route are perfectly fine.

### Tools

You can use whatever tools you're familiar with, meaning you can use any backend language/framework you'd like. You can also choose to write a separate front end or server render if you prefer. To give you some context, our stack is a Rails server rendered monolith where we use React and StimulusJS where needed. If you know those technologies, we would recommend trying to use them for this exercise.

We're primarily looking at your ability to write clean organized code, work with a database, interact with external APIs, and handle asynchronous JavaScript. So while the project isn't large, we want you to send us what you think is high quality code. Your commit history should clearly show your progression through the application.

You can also choose to add features if you want; however, we'd recommend keeping the feature set small and instead focusing on quality of the features you do include.

Recommended Backend Frameworks:
  - Rails
  - Sinatra
  - Express
  - Meteor
  - Django
  - Flask
  - Phoenix
  - Spring
  - Or anything similar
